read line by line and parse numbers

blank line indicates start of new elf

When you hit a blank line sum all of the parsed numbers and place that number into a "results" array. The index + 1 will be the elf and the value at the index will be its total calories

Once you go over all values get the max value of the results array and the corresponding index of the value. Add 1 to the index and that is the elf holding the most calories
